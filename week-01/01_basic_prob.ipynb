    "## Basic Probability (Recap)\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an experiment that can produce a number of results. The collection of all possible results is called the sample space of the experiment. A probability assigns every event a value between zero and one, equal to the likelihood that the event occurs, such that the sum of probabilities of all possible events = 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "$ P(A) $ = likelihood that A occurs in the given sample space.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ P(A \\cap B) $: If two events A and B occur on a single performance of an experiment, the intersection of ''A'' and ''B''.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a quick recap of basic probability functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Independent events \n",
    "\n",
    "If two events, 'A' and 'B' are independent then the joint probability is\n",
    ":$ P(A \\mbox{ and }B) =  P(A \\cap B) = P(A) P(B),\\,$\n",
    "for example, if two coins are flipped the chance of both being heads is $\\tfrac{1}{2}\\times\\tfrac{1}{2} = \\tfrac{1}{4}$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Mutually exclusive events\n",
    "\n",
    "If either A or B occur on a single performance of an experiment,  the union of A and B, denoted as $P(A \\cup B)$.\n",
    "If two events are mutually exclusive, then the probability of either occurring is: $P(A\\mbox{ or }B) =  P(A \\cup B)= P(A) + P(B).$\n",
    "For example, the chance of rolling a 1 or 2 on a six-sided {{dice}} is $P(1\\mbox{ or }2) = P(1) + P(2) = \\tfrac{1}{6} + \\tfrac{1}{6} = \\tfrac{1}{3}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Not mutually exclusive events\n",
    "\n",
    "If the events are not mutually exclusive then: $P\\left(A \\hbox{ or } B\\right)=P\\left(A\\right)+P\\left(B\\right)-P\\left(A \\mbox{ and } B\\right).$\n",
    "For example, when drawing a single card at random from a regular deck of cards, the chance of getting a heart or a face card (J,Q,K) (or one that is both) is $\\tfrac{13}{52} + \\tfrac{12}{52} - \\tfrac{3}{52} = \\tfrac{11}{26}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Conditional probability\n",
    "The probability of some event A occuring, given the occurrence of some other event 'B.\n",
    "$P(A \\mid B)$ : $P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}.\\,$\n",
    "If $P(B)=0$ then $P(A \\mid B)$ is formally undefined.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a bag of 2 red balls and 2 blue balls, the probability of taking a red ball is $1/2$; Now ince we draw a ball, the probability second ball being either a red ball or a blue ball depends on the ball previously taken. If a red ball was taken first, the probability of picking a red ball again would be $1/3$.\n",
