We used a probabilistic framework to decide wether to trade or wait, the ideal price to trade etc. To be able to do this, we need to know the probabilities of stock moves. Now we obviously can't know the exact probabilites, be can make some estimates if you know the underlying distribution. \n",

    "A major reason why it is so difficult to model prices and returns is due to the underlying probability distributions. A lot of theories and frameworks in finance require that data be somehow related to the normal distribution. This is a major reason for why the normal distribution seems to be so prevalent. However, it is exceedingly difficult to find real-world data that fits nicely into the assumptions of normality. When actually implementing a strategy, you should not assume that data follows a distribution that it demonstrably does not unless there is a very good reason for it."
