    "# Other Moments: Skew and Kurtosis\n",
    "Sometimes mean and variance are not enough to describe a distribution. When we calculate variance, we square the deviations around the mean. In the case of large deviations, we do not know whether they are likely to be positive or negative. This is where the skewness and symmetry of a distribution come in. A distribution is symmetric if the parts on either side of the mean are mirror images of each other. For example, the normal distribution is symmetric. "

    "## Skew\n",
    "A distribution which is not symmetric is called skewed. For instance, a distribution can have many small positive and a few large negative values (negatively skewed) or vice versa (positively skewed), and still have a mean of 0. A symmetric distribution has skewness 0. Positively skewed unimodal (one mode) distributions have the property that mean > median > mode. Negatively skewed unimodal distributions are the reverse, with mean < median < mode. All three are equal for a symmetric unimodal distribution.\n",
    "The explicit formula for skewness is: $$ S_K = \\frac{n}{(n-1)(n-2)} \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\mu)^3}{\\sigma^3} $$\n",
    "Where $n$ is the number of observations, $\\mu$ is the arithmetic mean, and $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation. The sign of this quantity describes the direction of the skew as described above. We can plot a positively skewed and a negatively skewed distribution to see what they look like. For unimodal distributions, a negative skew typically indicates that the tail is fatter on the left, while a positive skew indicates that the tail is fatter on the right."

This basically implies small positive moves are highly likely (more likely than small negative moves) and large negative moves are highly likely (more likely than large positive moves). This is exactly how stock market behaves. During good, bullish days, stocks slowly keep drifting up and generate small positive returns daily. When bad news bears, panic hits the market and stocks start moving down rapidly. Initial down moves cause further panic, leading to extreme down moves. Hence extreme down moves are more likely than extreme up moves. \n",
