    "Covariance measures the extent to which the relationship between two variables is linear. The sign of the covariance shows the trend in the linear relationship between the variables, i.e if they tend to move together or in separate directions. A positive sign indicates that the variables are directly related, i.e. when one increases the other one also increases. A negative sign indicates that the variables are inversely related, so that when one increases the other decreases. It is calculated as\n",

    "## Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation uses information about the variance of X and Y to normalize this metric. The value of correlation coeffecient is always between -1 and 1. Once we've normalized the metric to the -1 to 1 scale, we can make meaningful statements and compare correlations. \n",

    "where $\\rho$ is the correlation coefficient of two series $X$ and $Y$ and can range from −1 to 1; =1 or -1 implies that the relationship between two random variables can be perfectly described by a linear equation. A positive sign indicates both the variables increase or decrease together while a negative sign indicates one decreases as other increases. A value of 0 implies that there is no linear correlation between the variables.\n",
    "For example, if oil production in the world decreases, petrol prices rise. These two variables move in opposite directions, so their covariance will have a negative sign. How significantly can the petrol prices be expected to change is shown by the value of correlation coefficient.\n",
